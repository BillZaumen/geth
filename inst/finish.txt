When a Debian package is used to install gethdrs, the installer will
take care of the steps outlined below.  The installer
gethdrs-install.jar, however, is meant for a variety of systems,
and currently it does most of the installation, enough to make
the software usable, but does not configure the desktop.

The gethdrs directory (either /usr/local/share/gethdrs,
/usr/opt/gethdrs, or, for Windows, %PROGRAMDATA%\gethdrs) will
contain a file named share.zip. On systems that support the
freedesktop.org standards one should look at the environment variables
XDG_DATA_HOME and XDG_DATA_DIRS. These typically define directory
search paths, and will typically have a directory /usr/share in one of
these paths. With /usr/share as an example, running

    sudo unzip share.zip -d /usr/share/
    sudo update-mime-database

will create the necessary files.  The program update-mime-database
will allow the new icons to be used without first rebooting the
system. Similarly, the file gethdrs.desktop should be copied to an
appropriate location but with its Icon line modified to match the
location where the icon is stored.

In other cases, one will have to follow whatever procedure that
particular window system and operating system uses.

To configure a window-system that does not follow the freedesktop.org
standard, one should start by extracting various files from
share.zip. These files provide icons, either as PNG files or SVG files.
The file gethdrs.desktop can be used a guide.

The icons directory contains a directory named hicolor, which contains
directories named and NxN, where N is a postive integer.  Each of
these directories contains a subdirectory named apps, which contains
the icons used in lists of applications.  The files for gethdrs are
the following:

    icons/hicolor/NxN/apps/gethdrs.png

where N = 16, 20, 22, 24, 32, 36, 48, 64, 72, 96, 128, 192, and
256, and

   icons/hicolor/scalable/apps/gethdrs.svg

The "scalable" directory provides an SVG (Scalable
Vector Graphics) file so that icons of any desired size can be
created.  The NxN directories contain PNG (Portable Network Graphics)
files with the images having fixed sizes (N is the number of pixels
for the width and height).
