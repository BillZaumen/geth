gethdrs(1.1) unstable; urgency=low
  *  Changed the program name and the Debian package name to gethdrs.
     While this application predated some ethereum stuff by decades,
     there is another package named geth, so the name of the package
     and the command was changed to avoid a conflict.

geth(1.0.1) unstable; urgency=low
  *  Changed the frame width so its minimum size is computed on the
     basis of a label and text field. The reason for the change is that
     the minimum window size is system dependent.

geth(1.0) unstable; urgency=low
  * Changed the look and feel to use the system look and feel, with
    support for 'dark mode' toggling on and off. Removed libbzdev code
    as that can now be downloaded. Added a desktop file and icons to
    integrate geth with gnome.

geth (0.4) unstable; urgency=low
  * Allowed the -P option to be used when starting the GUI
    A test was also added so that the -p and -P options cannot be
    used simultaneously. The change was made so that geth, using its
    GUI, can establish connections to servers that use self-signed
    certificates, a common practice during initial testing. The manual
    was updated, with an example of the use of the -P option for
    servers created using the BZDev library's EmbeddedWebServer class.
