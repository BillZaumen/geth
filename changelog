geth(1.0) unstable; urgency=low
  * Changed the look and feel to use the system look and feel, with
    support for 'dark mode' toggling on and off. Removed libbzdev code
    as that can now be downloaded. Added a desktop file and icons to
    integrate geth with gnome.

geth (0.4) unstable; urgency=low
  * Allowed the -P option to be used when starting the GUI
    A test was also added so that the -p and -P options cannot be
    used simultaneously. The change was made so that geth, using its
    GUI, can establish connections to servers that use self-signed
    certificates, a common practice during initial testing. The manual
    was updated, with an example of the use of the -P option for
    servers created using the BZDev library's EmbeddedWebServer class.
