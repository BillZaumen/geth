geth (0.4) unstable; urgency=low
  * Allowed the -P option to be used when starting the GUI
    A test was also added so that the -p and -P options cannot be
    used simultaneously. The change was made so that geth, using its
    GUI, can establish connections to servers that use self-signed
    certificates, a common practice during initial testing. The manual
    was updated, with an example of the use of the -P option for
    servers created using the BZDev library's EmbeddedWebServer class.
